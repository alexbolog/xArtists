Project: NFT Staking
----------------------------------------

DONE Specs
  1. NFT staking contract
    - stake NFTs
    - stake SFTs
    - TODO unstake penalty?
  2. Proportional reward distribution
    - supports multiple ESDTs
    - keep track of reward rates for all reward tokens
    - custom score per collection/nonce
    - distribute based on total staked score

DONE Project Setup
  - DONE Initialize project structure
