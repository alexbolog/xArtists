Project: TRO Staking Smart Contract
----------------------------------------

DONE Project Setup
  - Initialize MultiversX project structure
  - Create basic contract file
  - Setup Cargo.toml with dependencies
  - Add init and upgrade functions

TODO Contract Storage Design
  - Define storage mappers:
    - User stakes (Address -> Amount)
    - Total staked amount
    - Reward rate
    - Last reward timestamp
    - User reward debt
    - LP token identifier

TODO Core Staking Implementation
  - Add stake() function:
    - Accept TRO tokens
    - Update user's staked amount
    - Calculate and store reward debt
    - Emit staking event
  - Add unstake() function:
    - Validate unstake amount
    - Update staking balance
    - Transfer tokens back to user
    - Emit unstaking event
  - Implement reward system:
    - Add reward calculation logic
    - Add claim_rewards() function
    - Add reward distribution mechanism

TODO LP Token Integration
  - Add LP token configuration:
    - Store LP token identifier
    - Set LP/TRO token ratio
  - Implement LP staking:
    - Add stake_lp() function
    - Add unstake_lp() function
    - Modify reward calculations for LP

TODO Governance Features
  - Add voting power system:
    - Calculate voting power based on stake
    - Include time-weighted voting
  - Implement governance token:
    - Add minting logic
    - Set conversion rates
  - Add proposal system:
    - Create proposal structure
    - Add voting functions
    - Add proposal execution

WAIT Security Considerations
  - Determine reentrancy protection needs
  - Decide on pause mechanism
  - Set minimum/maximum stake amounts
  - Define unstaking timelock period

TODO Testing Framework
  - Unit tests:
    - Staking/unstaking scenarios
    - Reward calculations
    - LP token operations
    - Governance functions
  - Integration tests:
    - End-to-end staking flow
    - Complex reward scenarios
    - Governance proposals

SKIP Future Enhancements
  - Emergency withdrawal function
  - Stake delegation system
  - Advanced reward strategies
  - Multiple token support

NOTE Development Guidelines
  - Follow MultiversX best practices
  - Document all public functions
  - Add comprehensive error messages
  - Include events for all major actions
